2.4 Store Operations
• Performance by Location: Stores in major metropolitan areas outperform those in smaller regions, both in total sales and sales per square meter.
• Size and Efficiency: Larger stores generally perform better, but some smaller stores are highly efficient in terms of sales per square meter.
• Expansion Opportunities: Data suggests that certain growing urban areas are underrepresented, indicating potential for new store openings.

2.5 Impact of Currency Exchange Rates
• Revenue Sensitivity: Revenue from sales in regions with volatile currencies is significantly impacted by exchange rate fluctuations, leading to variability in reported revenue.
• Currency Trends: The Euro and British Pound have shown significant fluctuations, which has impacted sales in Europe. Stable currencies like the US Dollar and Canadian Dollar have less impact.
Key Insight: Implementing dynamic pricing and currency hedging strategies can mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on revenue.
